Notes about the contained files.

		ADMIN - is a preset user and admin page can be navigated to if you login with username: admin and password: admin.


> Lab2.php: This file is where the project contains and begins. Its is the page that displays a user the register and login forms and directs them accordingly

> dbDemo.php: This page is where the user is navigated to once a user hits register and notifies then if they have sucessfully registered or not. Also handles the input to database logic.

> loggedIn.php: This page receives and evaluates the input then directs user to either normal user or admin page 

> userPage: Page dedicated for regular non-admin users which is navigated through 'login' from the Lab2.php. Simple page that consists of 3 buttons to toggle background color and and a 
            button to logout to return to Lab2.php(the register/login page).

> adminPage: Page is dedicated for admin user and is navigated through 'login' from the Lab2.php if user inputs username: 'admin' and password: 'admin'. Page has a table of all users and 
            is orginized by username assending order also has button to return to Lab2.php(the register/login page).

> Lab2.mysql : This file contains my sqldump
	- Note: To actually get this file to dump all the details I had to temporarily comment out the db_port and uncomment once the sql dump was completed.





<<<<<<Additional Bugs and Shortcomings>>>>>>

	- The only restriction for registration is that the input may not be empty for either username or password. 
		- A user can also register with a username or password that is already present in the database.
	
	- Extremely minimal CSS.

	- This project works properly only when in the htdocs file location on MAMP
